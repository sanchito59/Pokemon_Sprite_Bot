Pokemon Sprite Bot is a Twitter bot built with Node.js and the Twitter API and ES6 promises. The goal of the project was to explore using the file system utilities to download an image given a url and tweet that image. The bot pings the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/), grabs a random Pokemon, and creates a caption to tweet with the image. It is hosted on Heroku using scheduled dynamos to run.
